After having gone through what we consider the basis for web performance data collection and monitoring, you might want to collect more data regarding the user experience and page loading information of your pages.

In this section, we will be adding topics which might interest you in moving forwards in the web performance monitoring and optimization journey. If you have more ideas or specific requests, feel free to contact us!

### Performance Navigation Timing plugin

This Snowplow plugin allows for collecting data related to the [Navigation Timing](https://w3c.github.io/navigation-timing/) API. Navigation Timing data gives you access to the complete timing information for navigation of a page. Such information can include how much time it takes to complete DOM construction, if the page was reloaded or retrieved from the back-forward browser cache, how many redirects happened and more.

You find installation instructions and read more at the plugin [documentation page](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/collecting-data/collecting-from-own-applications/javascript-trackers/browser-tracker/browser-tracker-v3-reference/plugins/performance-navigation-timing/).
