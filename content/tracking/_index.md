Get started with sending web performance events using the JavaScript tracker.

Once set-up, you will be able to send web performance data to your Snowplow pipeline.

{{% notice note %}}
Currently the web performance data collection methods and metrics are more fit towards multi-page applications. For single-page applications (_SPAs_), the required measurements will need to be refined in a different way.
**If you have questions on how single-page application web performance metrics can be measured and collected, you can reach out to us!**
