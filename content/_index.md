### Web Performance Accelerator

#### Introduction

This accelerator will show you how to track and model raw [core web vital](https://web.dev/vitals/) events so that you can monitor your website's performance via the most essential metrics. Improving the web performance can have a dramatic impact on how your users view and interact with your website with the potential to maximize your revenue.

Here you will learn to:

- Learn how you can monitor your website's performance
- Set-up Snowplow Tracking and Enrichment to prepare your data sources
- Model Snowplow data
    - using the `core web vitals` optional module of the [snowplow_web](https://hub.getdbt.com/snowplow/snowplow_web/latest/) dbt package
- See it all come together in a Tableau dashboard
***

#### Who is this guide for?

Data practitioners who would like to:
- Easily capture `core web vitals` on their website using the Javascript tracker
- Report and visualize the proportion of vitals [within target](https://web.dev/vitals/#core-web-vitals) using Tableau

***

#### What you will learn

In an estimated minimum of a day (~5.5 hours) you can achieve the following:

- **Monitor -** Learn why and how you can monitor your website's performance
- **Track -** Set-up and deploy tracking needed for your website performance data
- **Enrich -** Add an enrichment to your data
- **Model -** Configure and run the [core web vitals(https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/dbt-models/dbt-web-data-model//core-web-vitals-module/) module of the `snowplow-web` data model
- **Visualize -** Use the Tableau twbx template (csv based!) to gain insight into your own website's health
- **Next steps -** Gain more in-depth knowledge on web performance with additional metrics
